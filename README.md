# Support-Vector-Machine-Classifier
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The notebook guides you through the process of data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using a linear SVM.

**Overview**
The project is designed to help users understand how to apply a linear SVM to a classification problem. The notebook covers key steps such as preparing the dataset, training the model, and assessing its performance with various metrics. It is ideal for those who are new to SVMs or looking for a straightforward example of linear classification using Python.

**Features**
Data Handling: Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
Model Training: Implementation of a linear SVM classifier.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using common metrics.
Visualization: Visual representation of the classifier's performance and decision boundaries.


**Requirements**
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Python libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib


**Usage**
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/svm-linear.git
cd svm-linear


**Install Dependencies:**

Install the necessary libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook:
